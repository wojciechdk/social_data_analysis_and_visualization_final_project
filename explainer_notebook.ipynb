    "> - What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "The work in this project is inspired by an article by [Martin Henriksen](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Henriksen), in which he warns the Danish population is being [replaced](https://ditoverblik.dk/martin-henriksen-advarer-befolkningen-udskiftes). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the fact that there are roughly as many interpretations of what it means to be Danish as there are people in Denmark leaves plenty of room for joyfull discussions, which I'm sure we will have the pleasure to witness everywhere from  television to social media for many years to come. I, however, have already reached the final truth in this topic and have therefore little incentive to further pursue this direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would, nonetheless, like to better understand the numbers that lead to the interpretations like that of mr. Henriksen, and have therefore reached out to KÃ¸benhavns Kommune to gain better access to their statistical databases. After a couple of phone calls with a gentleman called Martin, I have succeeded in persuading them to raise the limit of how much data could be withdrawn at once from 10,000 to 50,000 cells, which has made it possible to withdraw enough information for a more detailed analysis of how some of the demographical quantities in Copenhagen have developed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started gathering the data, I didn't have a specific goal in mind regarding what I wanted to investigate and present to the reader. Rather, I wanted the ideas to form while I was uncovering the data. To me, that's the beauty of data science - it's and endless journey where each turn you take opens up new ideas for where to go next. So, instead of choosing a particular message to pass on to the reader, I would like to invite them on this journey with me, and use whatever they find interesting and useful as a parting point to carry out their own study.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason I have attempted to document as much of the process as clearly as possible, and to leave the data in a form that will be easy to work with in the future. I have therefore used as much time as the norm for this entire course on gathering, cleaning, and organizing the data, as well as documentation thereof. For with good, clean data, the visualization work is a joy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I have no prior experience in webpage design, I have decided to go with the simplest possible design of a Jupyter Notebook, as learning to create webpages from scratch without any guidance would simply take too much time from the data analysis, which I would rather focus on in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have aimed to focus only on the data which would allow to trace the change of different demographical quantities in different districts of Copenhagen over time. This quantities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- citizenzhip (danes vs. western and non-western non-danes)\n",
    "- marital status\n",
    "- family type and number of children\n",

    "- life span\n",
    "- population movement (immigration, births, deaths, etc.)\n",
